# My first-react-app
This is a small todo app with backend support but no persistence as it lacks DB support.  I used it to learn the react framework.

I have a friend who wants to make websites.  So i decided to pickup the react framework real quick so that I could help guide him through any sticking points he may come across.

I started it off by utilizing the create-reacte-app node module and mostly followed the book
Create React App 2 Quick Start Guide by Brandon Richey published 2019.

I certainly detoured away from the book a bit as I incorporated react hooks and went with stateful functions instead of sticking with classes as done in the book.

I also strayed away from any robust testing as it was not my goal or intention (at this time) to learn the Jest testing framework.  I may revisit that in the future but that is a few steps away on my priorities.

There is no database functionality in this program so the todos created will only stick around as long as the backend express server stays alive.  I will likely revisit this in the futurue as data persisitence will be neccessary for any type of real world application.  Though, I expect that this will be handled on the backend server and will have little to do with react.

Thus, for now, I have ignored this entirely with the plans to come back to it in future projects.

Ny next adventure will be next.js.
